# PairBalance
Discord bot that creates a running balance between two users for when it gets too difficult to keep up with how much you owe. 

-- Everything within this project was created by a human's hands and mind -- 

This was created with the idea of partners, roommates, or just friends paying eachother back. Instead of "I'll buy you dinner to pay you back", you can add those dinners, grocery bills, and costly favors into a running balance that will even out what is owed. 
Inspired from living with a partner and needing a simple way to handle splitting expenses.
